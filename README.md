*The line chart above shows that the month that launched the most successful Kickstarter campaigns was May. However, January, June, July, and October all had rougly the same amount of failed campaigns launched. By filtering the data and the charts, I found that overall, theater is a very successful type of campaign with a spike beginning in June that seems to taper off by the end of the year.*

*After analyzing the failed and successful Kickstartes in the U.S., I found that failed Kickstarters had much higher campaign goals than successful Kickstarters. I recommend asking around the average successful Kickstarter goal of $5,049.*

*After analyzing Great Britain Musicals, looking at the boxplots for the goals and amounts pledged, the mean campagin goal was around 4,000 pounds. Since this is outside of the range of the outliers for the amount pledged, I would recommend trying to get your play produced for less than 4,000 pounds.*
